# Creating a README with markdown basics

## Introduction

This README explains why and how to create a README for a Github project, including a brief tutorial to create a Readme.

## Why create a README

A README should provide an overview of the project. It should pitch its content and level of detail to its intended audience.

It is good practice to write the README before starting a project as this sets a clear scope and set of goals for the project known to everyone involved before any code is written. Tom Preston-Werner, the co-founder of Github, wrote [this article](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) elaborating on why this approach is so useful.

Whilst there is not one universally adopted structure for a README, it can be helpful to adopt the WHY/WHAT/HOW model.

## How to create your README

Github will look for a file called README.md in the root of a git repository and display it by default. The file should be formatted in Markdown, a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML, which allows Github to display your page including advanced formatting, images and links.
