# React Router

React Router is a complete routing library for React for keeping your UI in sync with the URL. It has a simple API with powerful features like lazy code loading, dynamic route matching, and location transition handling built right in. Make the URL your first thought, not an after-thought.

If - for example - you had a calendar app, by default it would display the current date and the week around it. The default url could be "www.calendar.com". If we were to change this and do "www.calendar.com/week7", it only displays data from Feb. without having to go through multiple routes, and paths. The advantage of Routing means that you do not need to load data that is not needed.

There are 4 types of route components available with React Router:

- Route

- DefaultRoute

- NotFoundRoute

- RedirectRoute


### Setting up the basics

Install React-router in your terminal:

```npm install react-router --save```
